              <li><a href="https://vibes.stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-blue-600">Vibes</a> - Vibes is the first ever streaming platform to pay viewers and creators. Vibes also provides a free MultiStream plugin available to all creators. Vibes prides itself on being a platform that is easy to use, ad-free and has a great community.</li>
              <li><a href="https://twitch.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-blue-600">Twitch</a> - Twitch is a popular streaming platform that allows creators to stream their content to a global audience. Twitch is known for its large community and a variety of content. However due to the nature of the platform, it can be difficult to build a consistent audience and monetize your stream.</li>
              <li><a href="https://kick.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-blue-600">Kick</a> - Kick positions itself as a more “creator-friendly” alternative to Twitch by offering a highly attractive 95/5 revenue split, meaning creators keep 95% of subscription earnings while the platform takes just 5%.  </li>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-blue-600">YouTube</a> - YouTube remains at the heart of digital entertainment and education. However, the platform is more catered to video content than live streaming.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">Our Take: In the current market, Vibes is the best place to start streaming. With Vibes's MultiStream plugin, it's easy to tap into a large audience, by spreading your content across multiple platforms. However, redirecting your viewers to Vibes in order to benefit from the Watch-To-Earn program is recommended.</p>

        content={
          <div>
            <p>We will discuss the pros and cons of Vibes, Twitch, Kick and YouTube. From viewers and saturation, down to monetization and community, we'll cover it all.</p>
            <p className="mt-4"> <strong>Vibes Pros</strong> - Vibes Streaming will sit at the top of this list. The team at Vibes push continuous updates to the platform, and are always looking to improve the experience for creators and viewers alike. With Vibes's MultiStream plugin making it seamless for creators to stream on multiple platforms, to the Watch-To-Earn program, Vibes is the best place to start streaming, in our opinion.</p>
            <p className="mt-2"> <strong>Vibes Cons</strong> - However, Vibes is a relatively new platform, and as such, it has a smaller community than Twitch or YouTube. Vibes also contains a barrier to entry regarding its Web3 integrations. In order to receive payouts and participate in the Watch-To-Earn program, you must have a Phantom Wallet connected to your Vibes account.</p>

            <p className="mt-8"> <strong>Twitch Pros</strong> - Twitch is the most well-known name in live streaming, especially for gamers. With its large user base and established community features—like chat, emotes, raids, and channel points—it gives streamers access to a wide audience and interactive tools. For those already plugged into the Twitch ecosystem, it’s a familiar and reliable platform.</p>
            <p className="mt-2"> <strong>Twitch Cons</strong> - That said, Twitch isn’t without its limitations. New streamers often struggle with discoverability due to the platform's saturated environment and algorithm. Twitch also takes a significant cut of earnings (typically 50% of subscriptions), which can make it harder for smaller creators to grow sustainably. Restrictions on multistreaming for affiliates and partners limit flexibility, and recent changes to content and ad policies have caused frustration among creators. While Twitch has scale, platforms like Vibes are offering more freedom, better revenue models, and innovative tools built specifically for creators looking to grow.</p>

            <p className="mt-8"> <strong>Kick Pros</strong> - Kick has quickly gained attention as a newer streaming platform that offers an appealing 95/5 revenue split, allowing creators to keep more of their subscription earnings. It's also praised for its relaxed content guidelines and ease of entry—creators can start streaming without needing affiliate status or strict approval processes. For some, it feels like a more “creator-friendly” version of Twitch in the short term.</p>
            <p className="mt-2"> <strong>Kick Cons</strong> - However, Kick’s relaxed approach has also raised concerns around moderation and long-term platform stability. With ties to crypto gambling and minimal content enforcement, it may not feel like a sustainable or brand-safe environment for many streamers. The platform is still developing its discoverability tools and community features, and while it’s growing fast, it's yet to prove lasting value for creators beyond its generous revenue split. In contrast, platforms like Vibes are building tools with long-term growth, innovation (like Watch-to-Earn), and community safety in mind.</p>

            <p className="mt-8"> <strong>YouTube Pros</strong> - YouTube is the largest video platform in the world, with unmatched global reach. Its robust search engine, algorithm-driven discovery, and long-form content history make it a powerful platform for visibility and monetization. Streamers can benefit from VOD content, YouTube Shorts, and live streaming all under one roof, with multiple monetization options including ads, memberships, and Super Chats.</p>
            <p className="mt-2"> <strong>YouTube Cons</strong> - Despite its scale, YouTube’s live streaming community isn’t as tightly knit as platforms built specifically for live content. The platform’s strict monetization rules, algorithm changes, and aggressive content moderation can make it hard for new creators to gain traction or maintain income. It also lacks the streaming-first features and support that platforms like Vibes offer—from instant multistreaming tools to the Watch-to-Earn ecosystem designed to reward both creators and viewers. For creators who value flexibility, transparency, and innovation, Vibes may offer a more focused and supportive environment to grow..</p>

        content={
          <div>
            <p>When choosing the best platform to live stream, it's not just about audience size or payouts—features play a huge role in your growth, viewer experience, and stream quality. Let's look at what the top platforms offer and how they stack up when it comes to creator tools and integrations.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Vibes</h2>
            <p className="mt-2"><a href="https://vibes.stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-blue-600">Vibes</a> continues to innovate with built-in streaming tools, making it easier than ever for creators to go live and engage their audience—all without needing extra third-party apps. Recent updates include:</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">Built-in overlays for:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
              <li>Emotes</li>
              <li>Donations</li>
              <li>Subscriptions</li>
              <li>Followers</li>
              <li>View/follow counters</li>
              <li>Polls and voting</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">Native integrations for platforms like Kick and Twitch:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
              <li>View counters</li>
              <li>Chat display</li>
              <li>Alerts for new followers, subs, and donations</li>
              <li>Seamless MultiStream plugin to broadcast to multiple platforms at once</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mt-4">These built-in features remove setup friction and make Vibes an ideal starting point—especially for newer streamers who want pro-level tools from the jump.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Twitch</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Twitch offers solid native support for basic interactions, like:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
              <li>Chat moderation tools</li>
              <li>Emotes and badges for subs</li>
              <li>Alerts (with tools like Streamlabs or OBS plugins)</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">However, many streamers still rely on third-party tools to enable follower alerts, overlays, and donation systems. Twitch's native experience is streamlined but more limited without extra setup.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Kick</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Kick supports stream overlays and alert integration through external tools like StreamElements or OBS. It's compatible with major alert systems for:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
              <li>Follower/sub alerts</li>
              <li>Chat display</li>
              <li>Stream stats</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">Kick is improving fast but currently doesn't offer many built-in tools—streamers are expected to handle most customization themselves.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">YouTube</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">YouTube Live supports:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
              <li>Live chat, super chats, and memberships</li>
              <li>Scheduled "Premieres" and stream countdowns</li>
              <li>Integration with tools like OBS, StreamElements, and YouTube Studio</li>
            </ul>
            
          </div>
        }
        className="mb-8"
