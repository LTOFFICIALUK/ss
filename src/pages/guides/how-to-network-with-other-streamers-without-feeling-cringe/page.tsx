      question: 'Should I network with streamers larger or smaller than me?',

              Most streamers either avoid networking entirely (missing growth opportunities) or approach it in ways that feel 
              fake and transactional (damaging their reputation). Successful streamers build genuine relationships with fellow 
              creators that lead to organic collaborations, mutual support, and sustainable growth.

              Authentic networking isn't about using people - it's about building a community of creators who support each 
              other's success. This guide shows you how to network naturally, build real relationships, and create 
              collaborations that benefit everyone involved.
