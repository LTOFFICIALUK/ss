      answer: 'Earnings vary widely based on audience size, engagement, and monetization methods. Small streamers (100-500 viewers) might earn $500-2000 monthly, while larger streamers (1000+ viewers) can earn $5000+ monthly. Top streamers earn six or seven figures annually.'

      question: 'What are the different ways to monetize my stream?',
      answer: 'Primary monetization methods include subscriptions, donations, sponsorships, merchandise, affiliate marketing, and platform-specific features like bits or super chats. Diversifying income streams reduces risk and increases total earnings.'
    },
    {
      question: 'When should I start monetizing my stream?',
      answer: 'Start monetization as soon as platforms allow it, typically after reaching minimum requirements. Early monetization helps fund equipment upgrades and shows professionalism, but focus on providing value before asking for support.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I price my sponsorships and brand deals?',
      answer: 'Base pricing on your average concurrent viewers, engagement rate, and audience demographics. A common formula is $1-5 per average viewer per sponsored stream. Consider your niche value and audience purchasing power when setting rates.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What percentage of revenue should I expect from each source?',
      answer: 'Successful streamers typically earn 30-40% from subscriptions, 20-30% from donations, 20-30% from sponsorships, and 10-20% from merchandise. These percentages vary based on audience size, niche, and monetization focus.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I avoid being demonetized?',
      answer: 'Follow platform guidelines strictly, avoid copyrighted content, maintain appropriate language and behavior, and keep up with policy changes. Diversify across multiple platforms to reduce risk from single-platform policy changes.'
