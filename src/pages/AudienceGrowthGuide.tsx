  const audienceGrowthFaqs = [
    {
      question: 'How long does it take to grow a loyal streaming audience?',
      answer: 'Building a loyal audience typically takes 6-12 months of consistent streaming. Focus on quality engagement over viewer count - 50 loyal viewers are more valuable than 500 casual ones. Consistency in schedule, content quality, and community interaction accelerates this process significantly.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between loyal viewers and casual viewers?',
      answer: 'Loyal viewers regularly attend your streams, participate in chat, remember previous streams, and often subscribe or donate. Casual viewers may watch occasionally but don\'t form lasting connections. Loyal viewers provide sustainable growth, consistent engagement, and stable revenue streams.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I focus on viewer count or engagement rate?',
      answer: 'Prioritize engagement rate over viewer count. High engagement (active chat, followers converting to subscribers, repeat viewers) indicates healthy audience growth. A stream with 20 highly engaged viewers will grow faster and monetize better than one with 100 passive viewers.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How often should I stream to build audience loyalty?',
      answer: 'Stream 3-5 times per week on a consistent schedule rather than daily without consistency. Viewers need predictability to form habits. Quality consistent streams twice a week outperform sporadic daily streams for building loyal audiences.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the most important metrics for audience growth?',
      answer: 'Key metrics include average view duration, chat messages per viewer, return viewer percentage, follower-to-subscriber conversion rate, and stream-to-stream retention. These metrics indicate how well you\'re building loyalty rather than just attracting clicks.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I keep viewers engaged during slower stream moments?',
      answer: 'Prepare backup content like viewer questions, mini-games, story-telling, reacting to clips, discussing upcoming plans, or educational segments. Keep a list of conversation starters and community activities ready for natural lulls in primary content.'
