      question: 'How often should I stream to build an audience?',
      answer: 'Consistency is more important than frequency. Start with 2-3 streams per week on a regular schedule and maintain that rather than streaming daily without consistency. Your audience needs to know when to find you.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What types of content perform best for new streamers?',
      answer: 'Educational content, gameplay with commentary, and interactive streams perform well. Focus on providing value through tutorials, tips, or entertainment while engaging with your chat actively.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I come up with new content ideas?',
      answer: 'Monitor trending topics in your niche, ask your audience what they want to see, follow gaming news and updates, and keep a running list of ideas. Use tools like Google Trends and social media to identify popular topics.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I focus on evergreen or trending content?',
      answer: 'Balance both. Evergreen content provides long-term value and steady growth, while trending content can bring short-term visibility spikes. Aim for 70% evergreen and 30% trending content.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long should my streams be?',
      answer: 'New streamers should aim for 2-4 hour streams consistently. This gives you enough time to build momentum and allows viewers to discover you. Longer streams can work once you have an established audience.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I do if I run out of things to talk about during streams?',
      answer: 'Prepare talking points in advance, ask your audience questions, react to chat messages, discuss current events in your niche, or have backup activities like games or challenges ready.'
