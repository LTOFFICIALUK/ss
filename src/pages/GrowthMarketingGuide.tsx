      name: 'Optimize Your Stream Setup for Discovery',
      text: 'Ensure your stream title, description, and tags are optimized for platform algorithms. Use relevant keywords that your target audience searches for, and maintain consistent branding across all platforms.'
    },
    {
      name: 'Develop Your Unique Brand Identity',
      text: 'Create a memorable brand that sets you apart from competitors. This includes your streaming persona, visual elements, catchphrases, and unique value proposition that viewers can only get from you.'
    },
    {
      name: 'Master Social Media Marketing',
      text: 'Build a presence on Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube to drive traffic to your streams. Share highlights, behind-the-scenes content, and engage with your community outside of streaming hours.'
    },
    {
      name: 'Network with Other Streamers',
      text: 'Collaborate with streamers in your niche and related niches. Participate in community events, join Discord servers, and build genuine relationships that can lead to raids, hosts, and collaborative content.'
    },
    {
      name: 'Analyze and Optimize Performance',

  const growthFaqs = [
    {
      question: 'How long does it take to build a substantial streaming audience?',
      answer: 'Building a significant audience typically takes 6-18 months of consistent streaming with good marketing. Factors include your niche, consistency, content quality, and promotional efforts. Some streamers see rapid growth in 3-6 months, while others take 2+ years.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the best time to stream for maximum viewers?',
      answer: 'Peak hours are typically 6-11 PM in your target timezone, but this varies by platform and niche. Gaming streams perform well on weekends, while educational content may do better on weekdays. Test different times and track your analytics.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How important is social media for streamer growth?',
      answer: 'Social media is crucial for modern streaming success. It drives traffic to your streams, builds community, and increases discoverability. Successful streamers often get 20-40% of their new viewers from social media promotion.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I focus on one platform or stream to multiple platforms?',
      answer: 'Start with one platform to build an initial audience, then expand to others. Multi-streaming can increase exposure but requires more effort. Use tools like Vibes MultiStream to efficiently reach multiple platforms simultaneously.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I get noticed in oversaturated streaming categories?',
      answer: 'Focus on smaller, niche categories where you can stand out. Provide unique value like education, entertainment, or community. Build your audience in less competitive spaces before moving to popular categories.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What role does networking play in streaming growth?',
      answer: 'Networking is essential for sustainable growth. Collaborations, raids, and community involvement can significantly boost your visibility. Build genuine relationships with other streamers, not just transactional partnerships.'
