              Most new streamers focus on equipment, games, or going viral. But the #1 factor that separates successful streamers 
              from those who quit? A consistent, sustainable streaming schedule that builds viewer habits.
            </p>
            <p>
              When viewers know when to find you, they plan their time around your streams. This predictability creates loyal,
